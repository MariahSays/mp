  Futurism had a part in reiterating the idea that typography had the capability to be an expressive form of communication and art. 
  Its methods offered an alternative narrative of how type could and should be used, not as stationary elements but as forms of art and
  expression and signified a shift to modernism in design,especially in America(Meggs). It is considered to be largely related to cubism and
  impactful to art movements such as Dada, Constructivism, and De Stijl.
