  Popular during an era of civil grassroots and social rights movements, posters became more prevalent not just as street advertisements but
  as home decor. In turn, the style of these posters focused less on commercial benefit and more on social activism and cultural reflection. 
  The psychedelic movement stemmed from hippie subculture in America during this time, largely stylized to represent the feeling of 
  psychedelic drugs. Similar to pop art, psychedelia relied on pop culture images but utilized photo manipulation techniques to further alter 
  images and give them a “trippy” effect. This style is characterized by distorted lines and typography,and minimal blurred color contrast.
  The spread of this design style to more consumer products made it eventually popular with a younger audience.
