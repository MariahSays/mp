  Art Deco was inspired by and quickly followed  the Art Nouveau movement in France, but was largely interested in combining the decorative 
  aesthetics of Nouveau with the capabilities of industrial mass production. The introduction of the Art Deco movement was catalyzed by the
  seven month “Exposition Internationale'', a major exhibition hosted by the French Government in 1925. Art deco was quickly accepted as it
  was considered to be a mainstream form of cubism. Futurism, and De Stijl styles. Designs of this style were characterized by bold but sleek
  lines and a structured geometry, it demonstrated an adoption of what is describe as “pictorial Modernism”(Meggs)/
