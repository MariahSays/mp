  Influenced by Art Deco and streamline modernism in America, American Kitsch took futuristic and technological inspiration to an extreme. 
  It is largely considered to be inspired by and is representative of camp aesthetics. Kitsch was largely reflective of the social and 
  political status of America in the 50â€™s, demonstrating a comical element of separation from the events of the time. 
  Kitsch is characterized by vibrant and contrasting color schemes., exaggerated and fluid shapes, dramatic composition,
  and human forms which are often characterized in a cartoon or comic like manner.
