  Art Nouveau signified a design renaissance in Europe starting in the late 1800â€™s. Inspired by Asian wood-block prints, European paintings, 
  and the arts and crafts movement, Art Nouveau came during a time when international communications began to progress and signified a desire
  for exploration beyond traditional values following the industrial revolution. Design of this style is characterized by decorative and organic shapes, with common imagery
  including plants, flowers, and the feminine figure. Furthermore, the popularity of this style made it accessible internationally,
  allowing it to spread to the USA,UK, Vienna, and Germany(Vit).Alphonse Mucha was a print maker, specializing in lithography,
  whose enchanting works are recognized as a key example of Art Nouveau design style.
