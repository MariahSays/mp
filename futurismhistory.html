  Rooted in poetic liberation, Futurism is initially attributed to poet Filippo Marinetti and his work, The Futurist Manifesto. Marinettiâ€™s 
  bold statements were shocking  but resounded with poets and artists who strived for liberation. At its core, Futurism rejected traditional
  restrictions and principles such as alignment, harmony, balance, and grammar and suggested an expressive alternative. The idea spread
  throughout Italy,to France, and to America. Often, Futurism utilized traditional methods of printing and reproduction alongside specially
  arranged and pasted types for non-linear compositions.
