Memphis design is considered to be a facet of postmodern design, and emerged shortly after postmodernism was popularized. Memphis design style
originated with the Italian design collective of the same name, founded by Ettore Sottsass.  The group used furniture design to propose an 
alternative to the practicality and function of International design. Similar to postmodernism,  Memphis design can be defined by a separation
from corporate and international style. However, unlike its predecessor, Memphis design takes inspiration from art deco and pop art movements.
Relying on non-conformist design, it can be characterized by its bright colors, wild abstract shapes, and contrasting patterns.
