 Named for the German Design School: The Bauhaus, the Bauhaus movement was representative of a desire for enriched arts in an industrial 
 society. The school was founded with this goal in mind, to find a connection between the arts and craftsmanship and production. In 1924,
 the school was essentially forced to close due to the government, but its students and faculty found ways to move and fully resumed
 operation in 1926. It was during this time when the Bauhaus style became fully developed and  the Bauhaus magazine publication began.
 Although the founder wanted no style to be associated with the school, the Bauhaus style became associated with simple yet intentional 
 geometric shapes and primary colors.
