New Wave Typography in America emerged from the postmodern movement, taking characteristics from Internationalstyle and Postmodernism.
It differed greatly from Swiss style by utilizing the grid style not as a strict principle but a loose guideline to be broken. 
Additionally, it  stood out from postmodernism by focusing largely on type as an outlet experimenting with its capabilities.
The style is characterized by heavy typography, the usage of varying weights and styles, and geometric and isometric shapes.
