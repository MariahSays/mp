Pop art is recognized as a bold separation from minimalist design styles and originated in Britain before expanding to America.
Named for its reference to American pop culture, pop art uses different methods to provide a narrative of American culture. 
Characterized by graphic, representational objects, bright colors, screen printed style, and everyday objects, pop art was regarded 
as an easily accessible medium.
