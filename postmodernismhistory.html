  Postmodernism emerged in retaliation to corporate design identity and the accepted establishment of  International and Bauhaus design styles
  in design principles. Postmodernists sought to bend the rules of the established styles in order to make room for cultural and social 
  interpretations. Early on, it was regarded as a juvenile retaliation to established principles, but quickly emerged as a showcase of 
  creative innovation in 80â€™s. The early Postmodern style became characterized by depth in shapes and form, collage-like style, and an
  almost intentionally uncoordinated arrangement of elements, almost playfully.
