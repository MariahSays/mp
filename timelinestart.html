The earliest examples of communication are speculated to have started more than 14,000 years ago, with cave paintings. 
These elements of visual communication evolved into pictographic images and eventually the first evidence of cuneiform writing. 
This technology only evolved from there as different societyâ€™s further developed their own forms of documentation and communication,
eventually producing what we know as the alphabet.
