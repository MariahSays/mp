  Starting in Switzerland and Germany, the International Typographic Style, also known as Swiss Style, represented an almost concrete shift 
  in design and is attributed to the creation of the popular Helvetica typeface.  With an emphasis on using asymmetrical balance, 
  mathematical grids, and exclusively aligned sans-serif type, the movement focused on establishing a cohesive, universal, and scientific 
  approach to design. The approach to this design stemmed from an emphasis on science, and how information could be most efficiently 
  communicated.
